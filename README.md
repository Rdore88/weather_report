Normal mode- This program lets the user look up a variety of different weather options
for any zip code in the country. The user may choose from alerts, 10 day forecast,
sunrise, sunset or current conditions and then will be asked to put in the wanted zip_code.
If the instruction doesn't match one of the given options the program will say it
doesn't understand the instruction and if the zip code doesn't exist the program will
not run.
